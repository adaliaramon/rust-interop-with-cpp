# Running Rust from C++

This is a simple example of how to run Rust code from C++. A Makefile is provided to
build the Rust code and link it into the C++ code. Run `make` to build a debug version
of the code, producing an executable called `main` in `target/debug/`. Run `make
release` to build a release version of the code, producing an executable called `main`
in `target/release/`.
